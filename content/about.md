I am Computing Engineer, coffee enthusiast, and a life-long learner. 

I love to work making people more productive, that's why I joined **Microsoft OneNote and Microsoft Project for 3 internships @ Microsoft**. I am passionate about **compilers** and I built [my own language](http://github.com/danielsada) that compiles to CIL or MSIL. I am actively participating on #100DaysOfCode and you can see my progress on [100 Days of Algorithms](http://github.com/danielsada) 

I've built two companies so far, the first one is [Sadeira](http://sadeira.com) which is a consulting firm in Mexico that specializes in content, and the second one is [Bunti](http://bunti.mx) which is an app that connects Kindergarden teachers to parents.
