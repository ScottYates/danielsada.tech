I am Computing Engineer, coffee enthusiast, and a life-long learner. I love cooking and mixiology.

I work at Microsoft OneNote in the Sync and Storage Team developing services for millions of users, making them scalable and effective. 

I've done three internships in Microsoft. Two in Microsoft Project, and one in OneNote Sync and Storage. I am passionate about engineering culture, and how to transform organizations from within, I also love **compilers** and I built [my own language](http://github.com/danielsada/sada) that compiles to CIL or MSIL. I participated on #100DaysOfCode and you can see my progress on [100 Days of Algorithms](http://github.com/danielsada) 

I founded several companies, but the main one was [Sadeira](http://sadeira.com) which was a consulting firm in Mexico that specialized in marketing and software.
